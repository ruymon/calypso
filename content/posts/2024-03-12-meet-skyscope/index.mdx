## How it all started...

Over two months ago we started building Skyscope: a modern tool that helps flight aviation enthusiast get more out of their sim. Today we're launching our Public Beta and we'd love to hear what you think. Get started here

But before we dive into the details, let's put some names and faces to Skyscope. This all began with the shared frustrations by two regular flight simmers - Luciano and Ruy. Interestingly, our paths crossed over two years ago, not by chance, but as volunteers at IVAO. (Oh boy, we are getting old)

Back then, Luciano was IVAO Brazil's division tech lead and invited me to join forces in developing new tools for Brazil. As time passed, we both navigated through various roles across different networks, accumulating experiences along the way. Yet, amidst the changes, one thing remained constant: side by side, Luciano and I bring our unique experiences to the table, united in our mission to bridge the gap between the simple act of flying and the vast universe that lies behind it.


## Now on the our motives:

Despite this whole flight-sim world being in the end of the day, “just a game”, managing your flights; air traffic controllers around you; parking positions; weather information or simply flying for that matter, did not become any easier in the past couple of years. And whether you want to simply get more out of this all or spend less time planning and more just flying — it all requires a lot of juggling and time.

And the numbers don't lie that we need help when it comes to how we spend our time: we're overwhelmed, distracted and we have a hard time making time for things that really matter. Most of us work in-real-life and take flight simmulation as a part time hoobie. Imagine having limited time to have fun and on top wasting part. No wonder we constantly hear that this aviation universe recently feels less atractive than in the old days...

Skyscope is more than just a tool for us; it's a collaborative effort born out of a desire to address the challenges we, as enthusiasts, faced daily. We stand before you not as distant developers but as fellow flight simmers striving to make a difference.
